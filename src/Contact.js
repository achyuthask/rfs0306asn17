      Contact lenses, or simply contacts, are thin lenses placed directly on the surface of the eyes. Contact lenses are ocular prosthetic 
      devices used by over 150 million people worldwide,[1] and they can be worn to correct vision or for cosmetic or therapeutic reasons
      .[2] In 2010, the worldwide market for contact lenses was estimated at $6.1 billion, while the US soft lens market was estimated at 
      $2.1 billion.[3] Multiple analysts estimated that the global market for contact lenses would reach $11.7 billion by 2015.[3]
       As of 2010, the average age of contact lens wearers globally was 31 years old, and two-thirds of wearers were female.[4]

People choose to wear contact lenses for many reasons.[5] Aesthetics and cosmetics are main motivating factors for people who want
 to avoid wearing glasses or to change the appearance or color of their eyes.[6] Others wear contact lenses for functional or optical reasons
 .[7] When compared with spectacles, contact lenses typically provide better peripheral vision, and do not collect moisture 
 (from rain, snow, condensation, etc.) or perspiration. This can make them preferable for sports and other outdoor activities.
  Contact lens wearers can also wear sunglasses, goggles, or other eyewear of their choice without having to fit them with prescription 
  lenses or worry about compatibility with glasses. Additionally, 
there are conditions such as keratoconus and aniseikonia that are typically corrected better with contact lenses than with glasses.[
